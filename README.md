# LLM Self-improvement Implementation


Implementation for Qianxi Li's thesis. 

To install requirements, first create your environment, then run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install dependencies. 
To submit a job on Compute Canada - Cedar, just run " bash scripts/submit_job_7b.sh". We also have scripts to run different models, also in the /scripts folder.
